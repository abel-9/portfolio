            My name is Abel, and I&apos;m a software developer passionate about
            building scalable, feature-rich solutions that solve real problems.
            With a background in computer science, my projects focus on
            addressing challenges faced by organizations as well as creating
            tools that improve everyday life. I find fulfillment in seeing my
            work come to life and transform the way systems operate, making
            processes more efficient and impactful. Driven by curiosity, I enjoy
            exploring new technologies and learning from others, embracing
            diverse perspectives to continuously grow and refine my craft
